### Plan for Today:
- Ruby Basics
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Methods (might bump to tomorrow)


***Discussion on different kinds of Programming Languages:***

*Compiled Languages:*
Pro: Compiled languages are faster and are generally more memory-efficient
Con: You have to finish your program and compile it before you can run it.

*Interpreted Languages:*
Pro: Interpreted languages are not noticeably slower on newer computers for most tasks
Pro: Interpreted languages provide more instant feedback
Pro: Shorter, easier code to write (e.g. you don't have to declare variables)
Con: Uses memory less efficiently, programs run slower

*Functional Languages:*
ex. lisp

*Query*
ex. SQL (pronounced "sequel")

*Advice From The David Fisher: Learn some more languages! (eventually)*
1.Interpreted - e.g. Ruby √
2.C                      X
3.Functional - e.g. Lisp  X
4.Javascript             √
5.Query - ex. SQL        √


***Using Pry***

###Intro to Ruby###

Ruby is an interpreted language (as opposed to a compiled language such as C\C++) Ruby works in real-time: we don't have to write something, and then compile and then run it--with Ruby we can just write the program, and it runs it as type.
This means less code to do the same thing in another language: more efficient.

**FACT!**: Every line of Ruby code returns a value.

***Some of the Classes of Objects (kinds of info) in Ruby:***

- Integers: Numbers!
  * `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `326`
- Floats: Decimals!
  * `1.6`, `3.7`, `13.1`, `26.2`
- String: A sequence of characters, can be a variable or a constant
  * `"Apple Cider"` `'Pear Cider'`
  * single quotes: are whatever's in them (which is badass)
  * double quotes: have more power
  * String interpolation: `"Inside a string, print something that is  #{not-a-string}."`
- Boolean: get `true`/`false` as return values
  * Boolean operators: `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `==` `!=`
- Variables: by convention, we use lower-case and underscores for multi-word-variable names.
  * `=` is the assignment operator.  It assigns a value to a variable.
  * passing by value means that when a variable is assigned it is assigned to the original object/value and not the contingent variable  (see example of passing by value below)

Example of passing by value:

```ruby
    a = 42
    b = a
    b   => 42
    a = 41
    b   => 42 (!!)
```

* Snake case: underscore between words of variable names. We're okay with longer names.
    Ex) `this_is_an_example_of_snake_case = "yep"`
* Camel case: `ThisIsCamelCase`. We use this to name Classes and Modules; Ruby will let you use it for variables but by convention we don't.
- Constants: `ALL_CAPS`
  * Set once and never chance in program.
  * Ruby does not enforce the all-caps convention but it's good.
  * Ruby will allow you to change the value of a constant, but it gives you a warning.

How do you find what kind of data your thing is?  Use the .class method:
    `2.class`
    => fixnum
    `"apple".class`
    => string
    `1.0.class`
    => float

How do you find out the parent class(es) of an object's class?
`.class.ancestors` will return the list of parent classes of the object.

***Math!***

- Integer Division: (`/`) always rounds down.
  * e.g. `10 / 4 = 2`
  * If you use integers, Ruby will return an integer.
- Float Division: If you use a float in the input, then the output will be a float as well.
- Modulo (`%`) : returns the remainder of division
  * e.g. `10 % 4` ("ten modulo four") returns 2 because the ten divides by four twice with two left over.
- Exponents: e.g. `4 ** 2` ("four squared") = 16
- Repeating decimals stop at 20 digits, module bigdecimal can be used to store more digits
- Increment `+=` and `-=` (a= 10, a += 1, a = 11) a +=1 is shorthand for `a = a + 1`
- Concatenate: `"grape" + "fruit" = "grapefruit"`
  * `+` is a method you can call on strings and floats and integers, defined separately within each class probably
  * `"grape" << "fruit" = "grapefruit"`

Boolean operators:

- `==` equal to?
- `!=` not equal to?
- `>=` `=<`

Logical operators:
- `<=>` is first greater than, equal to, or less than second? returns -1, 0, 1 "spaceship operator"

    [52] pry(main)> 0 <=> 3
    => -1
    [53] pry(main)> 3 <=> 0
    => 1
    [54] pry(main)> 2<=> 2
    => 0

***What is the meaning of binary???***

Computers naturally think in base 2 (ones and zeroes) because all those tiny semiconductors work like a series of switches with on and off modes (actually high voltage or low voltage running through them, evaluated as presence or absense of electron flow), translated into ones and zeroes.

***Console and Strings CodeAlong***

_What is the difference between `puts` and `p`?_

* `puts` prints the result to the screen as a string ("put-string")
* `p` does the same as `.inspect`

_How do I quickly comment-out a bunch of lines of code?_

* highlight them and then use command-slash
* do the same thing again to
* take off the comments

'' vs ""
A string expression begins and ends with a double or single-quote mark. Double-quoted string expressions are subject to backslash notation and interpolation. A single-quoted string expression isn't; except for \' and \\.

Concatenation:
    `puts "David" + "Fisher" `

_What is the deal with `gets.chomp`?_

`.chomp` deletes the last character. When you type gets, Ruby records every keystroke including the return key. gets.chomp tosses out the return key that you inevitably had to type.

*** Conditional Statements ***

These statements return booleans.

`&&` means `and`
    returns true only when both sides are true
    [5] pry(main)> (1 < 3) && (4 < 5)
|| mean or
    returns true if either side is true
=> true

unless = if not
    e.g. `if user != admin` is the same as `unless user = admin`

##If Statement##

If (true)
  desired action
elsif (true)
  desired action
else
  default action if none are true
end
ALSO written as . . . desired action if true



case (or switch statement): another way of writing if...elsif

    ```ruby
    puts "Hello, there.  What's your name?"                         \n
    name = gets.chomp                                               \n
    case name                                                       \n
    when "tom"                                                      \n
	  puts "hello sexy."                                            \n
	when "fred"                                                     \n
	  puts "oh, hi fred. :/"                                        \n
	else                                                            \n
      puts "who are you and why are you using my computer?"         \n
    end                                                             \n
    ```

### anyone want to explain == vs =?###
== is a boolean operator - it evaluates *if* two things are equal or not and returns "true" or "false".
    I see `==` and think "is equal?"
= is an assignment operator - it assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.



***LOOPS***
- control structure. intended to repeat over something
- `while` loop: does thing while a condition is true
    `# This is an infinite loop         /n
    while true                          /n
        puts "do this thing forever"    /n
    end`

- .times
